This is an educational notebook introducing the so called Frobenius-Perron operator from ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The notebook is written in Julia and designed to be run as a [Pluto notebook]([url](https://plutojl.org/)) (https://plutojl.org/). To interact, download the .jl file and open with Pluto (requires Julia and Pluto be installed.) Static versions are available as .pdf and html which do not contain the dynamic interactivity. A cloud based interactive version through [Juliahub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Notebooks/msw283/My_New_Folder/frobenius_Perron.jl) is available as well. You have to create a Juliahub account to run the dynamic content, but it's free to do so :)
